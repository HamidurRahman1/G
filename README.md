# GraphGUI

<pre><strong>Graph Data structure implementation in Java with JavaFX. 
<ul>
  <li>It has some algorithms implemented like Show Connected components, 
  Cut vertices etc as well graph can be created by creatting vertices and edges.</li>
  <li>A random graph can also be populated by clicking 'Random Graph' 
  and delete the gtaph by clicking 'Delete Graph'.</li>
  <li>Vertices of the graph can also be moved after creation 
  by selecting and dragging them to new position.</li>
  <li>A new vertex can not be created on top of another existing vertx.</li>
  <li>Can count the number of edges, vertices, connected components and cut vertices.</li>
  <li>Able to add all possible edges once some vertices have been created.</li>
  <li>Able to remove an edge by clicking on top of the edge or close to it.</li>
</ul>
